❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible and not reusable.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Accepts two arguments `a` and `b`, making the function reusable and flexible.
* ✔ Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
* ✔ The complexity of the code is O(1), as it performs a single addition operation.

Additional Notes:

* Consider adding input validation to ensure that `a` and `b` are numbers.
* For further optimization, especially in scenarios with a large number of calls, consider memoization. However, for
simple addition, the overhead of memoization might outweigh the benefits.
